### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I am a 6th semester student at The National Development University "Veteran" of East Java, majoring in Information Systems. Having experience in internships and organizations has made me a communicative person, a hard worker, easygoing, easy to adapt to new environments, and someone who has the desire to always learn something new.<br><br>
ðŸ’¬ I also respond quickly, being critical of the decisions I make. I always give my best for myself and others to always be a better person. That's how I train myself to work hard and be responsible for all my results and decisions.
